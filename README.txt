Scrapers

These scraping bots make us of a Selenium webdriver with the BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from Kaggle and Code Canyon. 
Both sites contain dynamically generated components which made the scraping a tedious task. 
The Kaggle data was used for my data visualization web app called Visual-eyes. The Code Canyon data was part of a personal research project to explore the profitability of WordPress plugins.
